Created by a hobby-programmer.
Would love some feedback, as this is too much DRY-coded. 
Thought behind the code: 
  Run script once your linux is installed. 
  Detect distribution, update packages using pkg-manager based on distro.
  As most linux distro's does not come with pre-installed pip, this script will also install and update pip.
